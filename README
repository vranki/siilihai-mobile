This is a mobile client for Siilihai. It's written using Qt5 C++ & QML and
is intended to be used on Android and Sailfish platforms.

WIP, but seems usable.

Build instructions (General Qt/Desktop Linux)

 - get libsiilihai to a directory next to this.
 - qmake
 - make

This is easy.

Build instructions (Android)

 - get libsiilihai to a directory next to this.
 - download Qt5.8 android version (difficult to find)
 - get Android Studio
 - get Android NDK
 - get Android tools r25.2.5
 - cd Android/Sdk/tools
 - ln -s <path to Android tools r25.2.5>/templates .
 - Install Android API level 16 (4.1) development tools for arm/x86 as needed
 - open the Qt creator, configure the android SDK, NDK etc
 - open the project in QtC. setup the project for Android deployment
 - Choose Build | Deploy Project "siilihaimobile"
 - copy the resulting .apk file /android-build/build/outputs/apk/android-build-debug.apk
   to a android device and install it.

This is difficult. I bet something fails. Please update this README with new
findings.

Build instructions (Sailfish)

 - TBD
